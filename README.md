###Who Should Attend

The training will start at a low level and does not require in depth knowledge of the platform in question. Desirable participant profile: trainees and outside Globant candidates. A basic knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is desired, though.

→ [index](#bookmark=id.48b72f1065a3)

###Duration

Five weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and two weeks for app development. 

→ [index](#bookmark=id.48b72f1065a3)

###Technical Assistance

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance. We will create one chat for boot camp members only, and another one for boot camp members and tutors when boot camp starts.

###Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice and sprint

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

→ [index](#bookmark=id.48b72f1065a3)


###Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted. 

→ [index](#bookmark=id.48b72f1065a3)

###Materials

1. At least, three different browsers installed on the developer machine. Example, Chrome, Firefox, and the Android browser using Android's emulator.

2. The IDE to use is [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

3. Skype Account + headset (audio calls)

4. Create your own[ GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this[ guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account. 

5. Install your own LAMP server. Download[ WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) if you are using Windows, or[ XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) in case you prefer Linux.

6. Create a new repository in[ GitHub](https://github.com/)  to host the project code.

→ [index](#bookmark=id.48b72f1065a3)

 

###General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room. 

2. The next two weeks will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. The project manager will coordinate learning days encouraging team communication in daily meetings.

4. The project manager will gather information regarding individual progress so we can look for alternative assistance where needed.

5. The project manager will lead the boot camp sprints as if it were a real project using SCRUM agile methodology.

6. Two boot camp chats will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    1. Bootcamp HTML - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

    2. Bootcamp HTML - Assistants
Here you will reach just your boot camp fellows for asking question sharing knowledge.

7. Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

8. Sprint duration will be 1 week.

9. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

10. All code and documentation must be in English.

11. Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/javascript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

###Your First Project Starts Now!###

####It’s time for the real thing.####

You will work on a project to achieve a fully working multi platform mobile app developed in Javascript and using the latest tags and APIs available in HTML5.

You will apply all the knowledge obtained during the learning weeks.

You’ll be given with a backlog of user stories you will estimate with your PM.

Once estimated, user stories will be divided into sprints of one week.

You will participate on daily scrum meetings.
Will you be able to consult documentation? Of course! You will be able to use any resource you know that helps you complete your user stories, be it going back to documentation sites, tutorials or just googling what you need. Luckily the web is plenty of awesome resources waiting for you to grasp them!

####Commits####

You will commit your code to GitHub on a daily basis.

####Reviews####

Tutors will give you feedback at the end of each sprint by reviewing and commenting your committed code in GitHub. If possible tutors will give you even more frequent feedback, sometimes at the end of the day.
